We regularly host community events based around functional programming and OCaml including Compiler Hacking events, MirageOS Hackathons in the UK and Marrakech, Summer Schools and OSS Summits.

Together with academic appearances, members of the OCaml Labs team present their work to the wider community including programming groups, students, financial groups and other development teams, such as Facebook and Microsoft Research.

The Real World OCaml book was released in 2013, and still serves as a popular and useful teaching text for new and seasoned OCaml users alike.

We are always keen on collaboration and if you'd like to work together on a project, please get in touch!
