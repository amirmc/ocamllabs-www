[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) have released a limited availability
[beta
program](https://blog.docker.com/2016/03/docker-for-mac-windows-beta/)
for Docker users on Mac and Windows. It improves on the existing Docker
Toolbox and serves to simplify the installation process and allows
developers to build and test apps in a multi-architectural environment
whilst removing the additional dependencies.

The application features a native user interface, auto-updates and a
pre-packaged Docker toolset. The [Unikernels
Systems](https://blog.docker.com/2016/01/unikernel/) team who moved to
Docker have been part of this beta project, and the app utilises 40+
OCaml libraries, many of which were developed and published by the
[team](/wiki/People "wikilink") at [OCaml Labs](Home "wikilink"). We're
excited that OCaml libraries such as
[`astring`](http://erratique.ch/repos/astring/),
[`ocaml-ctypes`](https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes) and
[`ocaml-cstruct`](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cstruct) are receiving
wider exposure, and we can't wait to start testing it for ourselves!
