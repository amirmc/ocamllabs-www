[Daniel Hillerström](/wiki/Daniel_Hillerström "wikilink") visited [OCaml
Labs](/wiki/Home "wikilink") for the last two weeks to work on a native
backend for [Links](/wiki/Links_and_OCaml "wikilink") with effect handlers,
based on [KC's](/wiki/KC_Sivaramakrishnan "wikilink")
[multicore](/wiki/Multicore "wikilink") work in OCaml. It was a very
productive couple of weeks, and Daniel managed to implement a compiler
for an interesting subset of Links with multi-shot effect handlers.
--more-- It's a work in progress, but this is an excellent start! Daniel
also
[presented](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/s1467124/talks/ocl2016-04.pdf)
his work to the Systems Research Group in the lab, and we look forward
to welcoming Daniel back later this summer.
