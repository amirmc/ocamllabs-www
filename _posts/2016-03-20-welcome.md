New Blog and Wiki Format!
-------------------------

<summary [ hidden ]> There are so many new and exciting projects being
worked on by an increasingly larger [team](/wiki/People "wikilink") at [OCaml
Labs](/wiki/Home "wikilink") and to enable you to find all the OCaml-related
content you might need, we are centralising as much as we can here at
[ocaml.io](/wiki/Home "wikilink"). Please feel free to update pages you have
content to contribute towards, and bear with us during this transition
period. </summary>

You can expect to see updates on:

-   OCaml in the news
-   Upcoming [events](/wiki/Events "wikilink")
-   New releases and announcements
-   Collaborations
-   Project progress - see specific project pages linked from the
    [homepage](/wiki/Home "wikilink") e.g. [PPX](PPX "wikilink"),
    [Ctypes](/wiki/Ctypes "wikilink") and [HardCaml](HardCaml "wikilink")

Please contact **[Gemma](mailto:gg417@cl.cam.ac.uk)** with any feedback
you might have on the wiki, blog and content organisation.
