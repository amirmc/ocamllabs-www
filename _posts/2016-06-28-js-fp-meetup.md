The recent [LDN
Functionals](https://ocaml.io/w/Blog:News/FP_Meetup:_OCaml,_Facebook_and_Docker_at_Jane_Street)
event at Jane Street was a sell-out with a waiting list, so thankfully
Functional Works arranged another packed evening of talks on [2nd
August](http://www.meetup.com/London-Functionals/events/232615906/).
Yaron Minsky, Sebastian Funk and our own KC Sivaramakrishnan all spoke
to an active crowd.

The lineup was:

-   Yaron Minsky - Jane Street - "Building Reactive Web Applications
    Without Really Trying"
-   KC Sivaramakrishnan - OCaml Labs - "OCaml multicore and programming
    with Reagents.

    [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRWTws_YPBA))
-   Sebastian Funk - Jane Street - "OCaml: the ultimate configuration
    language"

Jane Street was once again a stunning venue, and we were lucky to have
Yaron Minsky visiting from NY to share his FP wisdom. He started the
evening off with a presentation entitled "Building Reactive Web
Applications Without Really Trying", looking at the commonalities
between and reactive web apps, neatly summarising

Jane Street [Tech Blog](https://blogs.janestreet.com/).

Our very own [KC Sivaramakrishnan](/wiki/User%3AKayceesrk "wikilink")
presented an engaging talk on [Multicore OCaml and programming with
Reagents](https://speakerdeck.com/kayceesrk/reagents-lock-free-programming-for-the-masses)
- successfully answering the age-old question of whether Multicore OCaml
will exist in the near future (spoiler alert - it will!).

The evening of talks was rounded off with OCaml, with Sebastian Funk
heralding OCaml as the ultimate configuration language, with lively
pizza-fuelled chat continuing late into the night. These are great
events to attend, and we'd encourage everyone interested in FP (and
especially OCaml) to join future meetings.
