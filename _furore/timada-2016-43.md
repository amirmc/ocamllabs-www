My research topic
- Started learning OCaml, and finished installation of OCaml on my laptop.
- Completed the chapter 1 of Real World OCaml and now following the chapter 2
- Felt I need to have a flexible mind to understand the OCaml language expression.

Others
- Arrived at Cambridge 16th Oct.
- Found my long term flat and I will make a contract with a landload in this weekend.
- Still setting up IT services (e-mail address, lab network, printer/scanner).
