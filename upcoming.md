### Compiler Hacking at Pembroke College

​Our first Compiler Hacking event of 2017 will be held at Pembroke College on 7th February!

If you're planning to come along, it'd be helpful if you could indicate interest via Doodle and sign up to the [mailing list](http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/cam-compiler-hacking) to receive updates.

**Where**
Room N7
Pembroke College
Cambridge​
CB2 1RF

N7 is through the second arch and on the left.

**When**
Tuesday 7th February 2017
630pm onwards

**Who**
Anyone interested in improving OCaml. Knowledge of OCaml programming will obviously be helpful, but prior experience of working on OCaml internals isn't necessary.

**What**
Fixing bugs, implementing new features, learning about OCaml internals

**Refreshments**
Either the Pembroke buttery between 545-645pm (cash only) or there will be a finger buffet in N7 itself.

We're defining "compiler" pretty broadly, to include anything that's part of the standard distribution, which means at least the standard library, runtime, tools (ocamldep, ocamllex, ocamlyacc, etc.), the debugger, the documentation, and the compiler itself. We'll have suggestions for mini-projects for various levels of experience, but feel free to come along and work on whatever you fancy.
